 Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gestures: This hands-free, gesture-controlled system uses Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, PyAutoGUI, and AIML to translate hand gestures into mouse actions like cursor movement, clicks, and dragging. Ideal for healthcare, AR/VR, and assistive tech, it offers a touchless alternative to traditional controls.
